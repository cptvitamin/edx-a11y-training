# Accessibility at edX

.subtitle[Mark Sadecki - Accessibility Coordinator]

.thirdtitle[Training for Course Teams]

### Accessibility at edX

* edX [Web Accessibility Policy](https://www.edx.org/accessibility) <https://www.edx.org/accessibility>
  * We understand and respect the unique needs and perspectives of the edX global community
  * We value every learner, and are committed to being a leader in expanding access to all, including learners with disabilities
  * Our goal is to ensure out software conforms with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ("WCAG") 2.0 Level AA

## WCAG 2.0 AA

.subtitle[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0]

.thirdtitle[Our goal is to conform with WCAG 2 AA]

---
### WCAG 2.0 Core Principles

* **Perceivable:**<br>Content must be presented in a way that all users can perceive it
* **Operable:**<br>Components and navigation must be operable
* **Understandable:**<br>Information and navigation must be understandable
* **Robust:**<br>Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents including assistive technology

---
### Platform vs Content

* Platform
  * .highlight[(mostly)] edX
* Content
  * .highlight[(mostly)] Partners (you)

class: title middle right

## Web Content Accessibility 

.subtitle[*In plain English*]

---

### What is *content*?

**Scope:** *Focused on content created using edX Studio*

* .highlight[Text]
* .highlight[Images]
* .highlight[Video]
* Lists (of text)
* Tables (of text)
* PDFs (of text and images)
* eBooks (of text and images)
* Assessments 

---
class: shift-down

## Text

* is accessible
* is translatable
* .highlight[can be read by *software*] (like Assistive Technology)
* can be transformed into other formats

---

### Problem: All (plain) text is created equal

.subtitle[Solution: Markup to the rescue!]

.thirdtitle[*By itself, text has no semantic value*]

---

### Why is markup so important?

.highlight[*Software is really good at reading markup*]

* Assistive Technology (AT) relies on markup to determine the "role" the text plays
* AT provides [shortcuts](http://doccenter.freedomscientific.com/doccenter/archives/training/jawskeystrokes.htm) to interact with markup
* AT users benefit *greatly* from these shortcuts
* Without proper markup, its just giant blobs of text

---

### Semantic Markup

What "role" does the text play?

* Is it a .highlight[heading]?
* Is it a list, or an item in a .highlight[list]?
* Is it a .highlight[link]?
* An .highlight[iframe]?
* Just a .highlight[paragraph]?
* Does it identify a column or row in a .highlight[table]?

*AT provides direct and enhanced access to all of these (and more). This functionality is not possible without the right markup.*

---

### Headings

* All AT provides multiple ways for users to browse by heading (examples):
  * Next heading (at any level)
  * Next level 3 heading
  * First heading
  * First level 2 heading
  
.highlight[Logical order is important]
  
*This won't work if your text just looks like a heading*

### This is a level 3 heading

.fake-heading[This is not a level 3 heading]  

---
layout: true

### Links

---

.float-right.scale50[![Screenshot of links list in Voiceover](assets/mIsec.png)]

* All AT provides multiple ways of navigating between links on a page:
  * By tabbing (of course)
  * In an .highlight[interactive list]
   * Where links can be directly accessed by .highlight[how they are spelled] or their .highlight[order in the document]

---
  
Bad:

* [Click here](#) to register
* Article teaser [More...](#)
* [Download](#) the white paper

Good:

* [Register for edX training](#)
* [What is accessible content: Full Text](#)
* [Download the PDF textbook](#)

---
layout: false

### Color contrast

* Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5 to 1
* Large text can have a ratio of 3 to 1
    * 18pt and 14pt bold<br>(roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% )
    
  <p style="font-size: 18pt">This is 18pt text</p>
  <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;">This is 14pt bold</p>
  
*Contrast ratios or nearly impossible to analyze without the help of [color contrast analyzing tools/software](#tools)*

## Images

.subtitle[We need to text all the images, too!]

.thirdtitle[The ALT Attribute]

---
### Text alternatives (using the alt attribute)

* Can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user.
* Authoring useful alt attribute content requires the author to carefully consider the .highlight[context] in which the image appears and the .highlight[function] that image may have in that context.
* Needs to be an appropriate .highlight[functional replacement] for the image.
* Can't be too long or require additional markup

---

### How do I determine what is *useful* alt content? 

*A good place to start is by asking the following questions:*

* Why is the image being included in a page? 
* What is its purpose?
* Does it provide useful information?
* Does it perform a function? 
* Is it a label for an interactive element?
* Is it purely decorative?

*Answers to these questions can help you use a simple decision tree:*
 
---

### Is this image the only content of a link or form control?

**Yes:** 
       
.float-right.center[![Screenshot of Introduction to Linux course card with an arrow highlighting the image linked to the course intro video](assets/EFAou.png)<br>![Screenshot of various social icons](assets/7xE4S.png)]
   
Use the alt attribute communicate the destination of the link or action taken

*A good alt value for this image would be "Watch the 'Introduction to Linux' course video", which describes the action, not the image.*
        
**No:** Next slide!

---

### Does this image contain text?

**Yes:** 
 
.float-right.scale40[![Screenshot of stylized text that represents the 3 main topics on the page, verbatim](assets/T2axY.png)]
       
* If the text in the image is also present as real text nearby, .highlight[use an empty alt attribute] to hide the image from screen reader users.

* If the text included is just for visual effect, use an empty alt attribute.

* Otherwise, use the alt attribute to include the communicative text of the image.
        
**No:** Next slide! 
 
---

### Does this image contain text?

**Yes:** 
 
.float-right.scale40[![Screenshot of computer code transparently overlaying a computer keyboard](assets/LFS01_Ch0_Screen7.jpg)]
             
* If the text in the image is also present as real text nearby, use an empty alt attribute to hide the image from screen reader users.
 
* If the text included is just for visual effect, .highlight[use an empty alt attribute].

* Otherwise, use the alt attribute to include the communicative text of the image.
        
**No:** Next slide!

---

### Does this image contain text?

**Yes:** 

<figure class="float-right scale40">
  <img src="assets/fGqVI.png" alt="Screenshot of stylized text illustrating 3 points">
  <figcaption>Appropriate alt for this image would be: "1: Things change in linux. 2: We've repeated some things in the class. 3: We've tried to avoid holy wars."</figcaption>
</figure>
             
* If the text in the image is also present as real text nearby, use an empty alt attribute to hide the image from screen reader users.
        
* If the text included is just for visual effect, use an empty alt attribute.

* Otherwise, use the alt attribute to .highlight[include the communicative text of the image].
        
**No:** Next slide! 

---

### Does the image contribute meaning to the current page or context?

* **Yes**, and it’s a simple graphic or photograph: .highlight[the alt attribute should briefly describe the image in a way that conveys that meaning].
* **Yes**, and it’s a graph or complex piece of information: .highlight[include the information contained in the image elsewhere on the page].
* **Yes**, but a suitable alt text is unknown at the time of publication (for example on a photo upload site): .highlight[provide an alt attribute or caption for the image that includes as much useful information as possible].
        
**No:**

Next slide!
 
---

### Is the image purely decorative or not intended for the user?
        
* Use an .highlight[empty alt attribute].  This will make it invisible to a screen reader user.

## Video

* All sound needs to have a textual equivalent
  * Timed Text Captions
  * Transcript

* All on screen text needs to have an audible equivalent
  * And non-text content that is important to the context of the video must also have an audible equivalent<br>
  .highlight[Audio Description]
